Model
-----

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on labeled ECG images. The architecture is optimized for high accuracy and low inference time.

### Model Highlights:

*   Framework: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (specify what you used).
    
*   Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented.
    
*   Training: Model is trained for **X epochs** using **Adam optimizer**.)
